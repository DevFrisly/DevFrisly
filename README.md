## Hi there 👋
I'm DevFrisly, a learning Developer based in India.
I'm Currently learning Javascript & C language.

I mostly work on Frontend Stuff - Tailwind CSS, Vanilla CSS and a bit of animation.
I also use Figma and Adobe XD for UI design.
I also have a great interest in Physics, Game Development and IoT projects.

This is a fresh profile I'll be uploading some smaller projects, exeriments, and things I'm currently working on. 
Everything here is build from scratch, no copy/paste templates.
