## Hi there 👋
I'm DevFrisly, a learning Developer based in India.<br>
I'm Currently learning Javascript & C language.<br>

I mostly work on Frontend Stuff - Tailwind CSS, Vanilla CSS and a bit of animation.<br>
I also use Figma and Adobe XD for UI design.<br>
I also use GeminiAI and ChatGPT sometimes for coding experimental projects, it helps a lot to learn things easily.<br>
I also have a great interest in Physics, Game Development and IoT projects.<br>
<hr>
This is a fresh profile I'll be uploading some smaller projects, experiments, and things I'm currently working on.<br>
Everything here is build from scratch, no copy/paste templates.<br>
